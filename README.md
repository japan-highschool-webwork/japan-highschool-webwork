# Japan High-School WeBWorK Project  
High-School Mathematics Problem Library & Japanese Localization (Unofficial)

This repository provides:

- A Japanese problem library for **high-school level mathematics**  
  (Math I, Math A, Math II, Math B)
- Sample PG/PGML problems
- Curriculum mapping for Japanese national high-school standards
- Resources for Japanese localization of WeBWorK

---

## 🎯 Purpose of This Project
This project focuses **exclusively on Japanese high-school mathematics**.  
University-level WeBWorK development in Japan has already been led by other pioneers,  
so this project aims to fill the *high-school* gap and provide a structured PG/PGML library  
for secondary mathematics.

## 🧪 Status
The project is currently in an early stage.  
Initial sample problems for **Math I** will be added soon, followed by Math A・II・B.

---

## ✍ Supported Formats
Both **PG** and **PGML** formats are supported.  
Each will be chosen appropriately depending on the structure of the problem.
