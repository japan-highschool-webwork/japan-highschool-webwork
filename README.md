# Japan High-School WeBWorK Project  
High-School Mathematics Problem Library & Japanese Localization (Unofficial)

This repository provides:

- A Japanese problem library for **high-school level mathematics**  
  (Math I, Math A, Math II, Math B)
- Sample PG/PGML problems
- Curriculum mapping for Japanese high-school standards
- Resources for Japanese localization of WeBWorK

---

## Project Scope
This project focuses **exclusively on high-school mathematics** in Japan.  
University-level WeBWorK development in Japan has been led by other pioneers,  
and this project is completely independent and complementary to those efforts.

---

## Formats
Both **PG** and **PGML** formats are supported.  
Each will be chosen appropriately depending on the structure of the problem.

---

## Repository Structure

```
problems/         # High-school math problem sets
localization/     # Japanese language resources (future)
docs/             # Documentation and curriculum mapping
```

---

## Status
This project is currently in an early stage.  
Initial sample problems for **Math I** will be added soon.
